Assignment 1

Description
I'm currently working on different ways to ouput numbers in python. Some of these methods we're using are double precision with binary numbers, rounding and chopping those numbers, completely the absolute and relatie error, and using the bisection and newton raphson method to figure out how many iterations we need to solve an equation.

Installation
__init__.py: In this, import any needed packages. For this assignment you will need: 'import numpy as np' and 'import math'.

requirements.txt: create a file in your explorer in codespace and name it 'requirements.txt'. In this file, you should type 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' into the terminal to install numpy.

After your code is typed you can run it by either hitting the run button or clicking the triangle by where your files are.
